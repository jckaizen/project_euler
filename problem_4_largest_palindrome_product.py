# A palindromic number reads the same both ways.
# The largest palindrome made from the product of 
# two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

z = 0


# Assumption: It's pointless to check all the way towards 100s and slightly
# higher. So I'll just look in 900s since the chances are higher that
# the largest palindrome product is here.
